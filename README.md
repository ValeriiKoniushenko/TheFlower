# The Flower Game

# Intro
I have created a game about flowers and snakes. We should survive! Plant a flower and don't be killed by a snake!

## Technical cases
- Serializing of all data(the Window_'s size, warms' position, flowers' position etc)
- Wrote GTest-s for testing core parts of the game
- Supporting of GameStates
- Implemented main UI features: Widget, Canvas, Button
- Implemented a game economic: we can plant every 0.5 second one Flower and get 5 coins per 3 seconds
